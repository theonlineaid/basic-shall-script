### Examples of Date Formatting

Here are some examples of using the `date` command with different formatting options:

1. **Current Date and Time**:
   ```bash
   date
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Sun Oct 14 15:05:09 UTC 2024
   ```

2. **Formatted Date**:
   ```bash
   date +"%Y-%m-%d"
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   2024-10-14
   ```

3. **Formatted Date and Time**:
   ```bash
   date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   2024-10-14 15:05:09
   ```

4. **Full Date with Weekday**:
   ```bash
   date +"%A, %B %d, %Y"
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Sunday, October 14, 2024
   ```

5. **Custom Format**:
   ```bash
   date +"Today is %A, the %d of %B %Y"
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Today is Sunday, the 14 of October 2024
   ```

### Working with Different Time Zones

You can also format dates based on different time zones by setting the `TZ` variable temporarily:

```bash
TZ="America/New_York" date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z"
```

### Manipulating Dates

You can also perform arithmetic operations on dates. For example, to get the date 5 days from now:

```bash
date -d "+5 days" +"%Y-%m-%d"
```

Bash provides a powerful way to format and manipulate dates using the `date` command. Understanding these formatting options can help you display dates in the format you need for scripts and command-line applications.
