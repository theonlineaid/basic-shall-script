In this example:

```bash
name="not a person"

unset name

echo $name
```

Hereâ€™s what happens:

1. `name="not a person"`: This line sets the variable `name` with the value `"not a person"`.
2. `unset name`: This command deletes the `name` variable from the shell environment, effectively removing its value.
3. `echo $name`: Since `name` has been unset, `$name` now has no value, so this line will output an empty line.

### Expected Output
```
(empty output)
```

Since the variable `name` was unset, there is no value to display when you use `echo $name`. 

### Important Note on `readonly`
If you had made `name` a **read-only** variable, like this:
```bash
readonly name="not a person"
unset name  # This would cause an error: cannot unset readonly variable
```

Then `unset name` would cause an error because read-only variables cannot be modified or unset.
