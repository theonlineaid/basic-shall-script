In Bash scripting, `fi` is used to mark the end of an `if` statement. It is the reverse of the `if` keyword, signifying the conclusion of the conditional block. This is part of the syntax used in control structures in Bash.

### Syntax of an `if` Statement

Here is the basic structure of an `if` statement in Bash, including the use of `fi`:

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # commands to execute if the condition is true
else
    # commands to execute if the condition is false (optional)
fi
```

### Example of Using `if` and `fi`

Hereâ€™s a simple example that checks if a number is greater than 10:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

number=15

if [ $number -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "$number is greater than 10."
else
    echo "$number is not greater than 10."
fi
```

### Breakdown of the Example

1. **Condition**: The condition being tested is whether `number` is greater than 10 (`[ $number -gt 10 ]`).
2. **Then Block**: If the condition is true, the commands within the `then` block are executed.
3. **Else Block**: If the condition is false, the commands within the `else` block are executed (optional).
4. **Ending with `fi`**: The `fi` keyword marks the end of the `if` statement.

### Summary

- **`if`**: Starts the conditional statement.
- **`then`**: Introduces the block of commands to execute if the condition is true.
- **`else`**: (Optional) Introduces the block of commands to execute if the condition is false.
- **`fi`**: Marks the end of the `if` statement.

Understanding the structure of `if` statements in Bash, including the use of `fi`, is essential for controlling the flow of logic in your scripts. If you have more questions about conditional statements or other Bash concepts, feel free to ask!
