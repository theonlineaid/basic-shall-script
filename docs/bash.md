The `#!/bin/sh` and `#!/bin/bash` at the top of a shell script are **shebang lines** that specify which interpreter to use when running the script. Here’s the difference between the two:

### `#!/bin/sh`
- **Points to the `sh` shell**: Historically, `sh` refers to the **Bourne shell** (an earlier Unix shell).
- **Basic compatibility**: It is more universally available and is often used for compatibility across Unix-like systems.
- **Limited features**: It typically includes only basic shell features and excludes newer, more advanced features available in `bash`.
- **POSIX compliance**: `/bin/sh` is usually POSIX-compliant, meaning it conforms to the Portable Operating System Interface standard, which defines a standard environment for Unix-based systems.

### `#!/bin/bash`
- **Points to the `bash` shell**: This line invokes **Bash (Bourne Again SHell)**, an improved and extended version of the original Bourne shell.
- **More features**: `bash` includes additional functionality, such as advanced string manipulation, arrays, and improved scripting syntax (like `[[ ... ]]` for conditionals).
- **More Linux-specific**: `bash` is the default shell on most Linux distributions, but it may not be available by default on all Unix-like systems, like some BSD systems or macOS (where `/bin/sh` may still point to a more basic shell).

### Which One to Use?
- **Use `#!/bin/sh`** if you want maximum portability and don’t need advanced `bash`-specific features. Scripts with `#!/bin/sh` are likely to run on almost any Unix-like system.
- **Use `#!/bin/bash`** if you need `bash`-specific features or are writing scripts that will primarily run on systems where `bash` is available (like Linux).

### Example
Here's a small example to show a `bash`-specific feature (`[[ ... ]]`) that would only work in `#!/bin/bash` and not in `#!/bin/sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [[ -f "file.txt" ]]; then
  echo "File exists."
fi
```

If you try to run this with `#!/bin/sh`, it may not work because `[[ ... ]]` is a `bash`-specific syntax.
